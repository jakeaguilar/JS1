var myString = "Hello World*76";

console.log(typeof myNumber);

//good way of naming bools is using is? like Is the user logged in?
var isLoggedIn = false; //boolean

//if you see a "variable" in the console on chrome is "not defined"
var newVariable;
console.log(newriable);// purposely wrong!! will give error above ^^

//null varialble will literally just say null!
//isLoggedIn = null;
