var classDesires = "CLASS DESIRES: After receiving my degree in IT/Software Engineering from\
                    University of Phoenix this past April, i honestly felt as if i accomplished\
                    nothing. I felt as if i did not learn how to develop software \
                    let alone a website from start to finish. However, i am lucky \
                    that i live in FresYes, and have the opportunity to attend \
                    Bitwise/GeekWise. I want to make a career out of doing somthing \
                    that i love to learn about. I love the idea of literally having \
                    nothing but a concept and turning that into a piece of tech. \
                    I also fell on hard times recently, after having multiple differnt jobs \
                    i found a job that i thought i could make money selling insurance. \
                    After 6 months, things started going south. As i had moved out of my parents place \
                    before i saved up enough money to support myself. I fell behind on my rent, \
                    car payment, and literally everything else you can think of. In the end, \
                    i had to move back in with my parents, and that was demoralizing to say the least \
                    Now i have realized that i WANT to become a developer so much, just so i can live \
                    the life i want to live. Sorry, kind of went off on a tangent there but i felt \
                    it was necessary to explain my past to vocalize just how badly i want to become a developer. \
                    And that actual first step, was me stepping into room 3 of my first Bitwise class on July 2nd, 2018";

//My favorite hobby to do when i am not working, learning, or spending time with family or friends.

                In fact, i believe it is what really got me into technology in the first place.\
